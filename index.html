        <p>The dog is a pet animal. A dog has sharp teeth so that it can eat flesh very easily,
             it has four legs, two ears, two eyes, a tail, a mouth,
              and a nose. It is a very clever animal and is very useful in catching thieves.
             It runs very fast, barks loudly and attacks the strangers.</p>
